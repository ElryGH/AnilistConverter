A simple Tool to Convert Anilist Lists from Manga to Anime or Anime to Manga. Written in C# & XAML.

## How it works
It opens a Website to authorize the App, you get an API Token back, paste that in the app in the correct field.

After that you simply select if you want to convert Anime to Manga or Manga to Anime

Then select the range (Only Planned or All) & click the Start button.

Now you see your list get converted, with a progress bar and everything.

Should the app not be able to find a entry as Anime or Manga, it will get displayed afterwards as a List.
